# ThiPy - Bangkok Python Meetup - meetups
A repo for the ThaiPy Meetup Group - https://www.meetup.com/thaipy-bangkok-python-meetup/

## Meetup Ideas
Got an idea for a presentation or lightning talk? Great - [open a "I want to talk" discussion](https://github.com/thaipy/meetups/discussions/new?category=i-want-to-give-a-talk) and we'll see where it fits on our calendar.

Like someone's idea and want to hear it next? Then [+1 away](https://github.com/thaipy/meetups/discussions)!

Not sure if you can give a talk but have an idea of a great topic you'd like to hear? [open a "talk idea" discussion](https://github.com/thaipy/meetups/discussions/new?category=talk-ideas)

## Decks & Notes
We want to publish any supporting notes, code, slide decks, photos or videos you may have from our meetups. So if you've got anything you'd like to share, just fork this repo, add your material to the appropriate folder pull away (pull request that is). Also, to keep things neat and tidy, try using branch names like 2013-10-29 so it's clear what meetup it is for.

## Thanks

Thanks to the [BrisRuby group](https://github.com/BrisRuby/meetups) for inspiring this approach!
